Learning NN using PyTorch
# PyTorch MNIST: ANN vs CNN
The implementation and comparison of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
using the MNIST handwritten digits dataset in PyTorch.
## What I Learned
- Why tensors are used in neural networks
- Difference between ANN and CNN
- How convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers work
- How backpropagation and gradient descent update weights
- Training models using CrossEntropyLoss
- Evaluating accuracy on test data
- CPU vs GPU execution in PyTorch

## Models
### ANN
- Input: 28×28 flattened image
- Fully connected layers
- ReLU activations

### CNN
- Convolution + ReLU
- MaxPooling
- Fully connected layers

## Results
CNN outperforms ANN on MNIST due to spatial feature learning.
